        <h1>Is ‘common sense’ universal?</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Common sense is actually a biased perspective or opinion held by an individual on any issue or matter. 
            This, however, does not imply that it is either good or bad. It merely suggests that what seems very common for 
            one individual is only because such a social phenomenon is prevalent and widely accepted in the social setting 
            around which that particular individual grew up or lives. Therefore chances are that what is common for one 
            individual can be totally incomprehensible or uncommon for another. For example - For someone belonging to an 
            egalitarian society would find the idea of a woman compulsorily doing all the house chores in a family quite 
            repulsive. Whereas, someone from a deeply patriarchal society would only say “Yes. Why not?”
        </p>
        <p> It is, therefore, the social context in which we are born that greatly shapes our thinking. We cannot help it but 
            we can definitely observe and try to find the fault- not in our stars but in our thinking so that someday we can 
            actually “Imagine all the people living life in peace!”</p>
