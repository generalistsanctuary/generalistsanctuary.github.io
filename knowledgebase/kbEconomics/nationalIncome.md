# National Income

Consider the following code-


Looks beautiful ? Without a doubt. But what do these lines of code actually want to say ? For those who are familiar or ever had to come across any programming language in their life would know that it simply says "Hello, world!".  And for those who are not familiar with it can try locating - **printf ("Hello, World!")** in the image. This is national income.

Here comes the explainer. As you would have rightly noticed, all the fancy and colorful lines are indeed inputs which transform themselves into an output. National income like "Hello, World" is the output created by numerous economic activities-  like lines of code- which are carried out by a country's citizens, both within and outside the territorial boundary of the country. 

> **It is therefore the total of all the individual income that the citizens of a particular country earn.**

This act of adding incomes is constrained by the ever pervasive factor called time. Therefore national income is measured periodically and not when the person responsible for measuring it is not procrastinating. 

> **National income therefore is the total of all the individual income that the citizens of a particular country earn over a fixed period of time, generally a year.**

Time is an essential factor because it allows us to determine whether the national income of a country is increasing or decreasing when compared over two different time periods. This enables policy makers to intervene with appropriate policies as and when the need arises.

Using an equation national income can be expressed as, 

**Gross national income = Gross domestic product (GDP) + Net primary income**

If it sounds so simple why doesn't it look so simple? The answer to this is because it is not so simple to measure individual income. This can be attributed to lack of resources (even if there was no dearth of resources the whole exercise wouldn't be sustainable) or lack of digitization of earnings among various other factors. As a result we use two other variables to measure national income.

**GDP:**

GDP or gross domestic product of a country gives us the total value of goods and services produced in the territory of a country over a fixed period of time. Using mankind's greatest tool- reverse engineering-we can now briefly think of it in this way: 

Since the goods and services amount to a certain value and given the circular nature of flow of income, it must mean that the production process has led to someone earning money from it. This can be either in the form of wages in exchange of labor, rent in exchange of land to carry out production, or for that matter income earned from profits after selling those goods and services. This is therefore an indirect method to calculate income generated due to economic activity. 

If that is the case then shouldn't GDP encompass the entire gamut of possible incomes? Yet, we are in this limbo with another variable. 

**Net Primary Income:**

The purpose of the second variable can be best understood by recalling that citizens of a country need not always reside within the territory of the country. For example- Let us consider one Mr. Nemo living in Australia but being a citizen of another country, say India. Since Mr. Nemo lives and earns in Australia his income (wage, rent, profit) would be generated from products which are a part of Australia's GDP. However, as Mr. Nemo is India's citizen his income would be accounted for while calculating India's national income. This income can be accounted for only if we enter another variable. If we use only GDP as the parameter to measure national income then it would be difficult finding Nemo's contribution since it remains unaccounted and therefore would be an incorrect measure.

Similarly, there might be Ms. Omen who is living in India but is a citizen of Australia. Her income would be generated from products which are a part of India's GDP. But as she is a citizen of Australia her income must not be accounted for while calculating India's national income.

Building on what we have learned so far we therefore can say that national income of a country is calculated indirectly from the value of goods and services of that country as production of goods and services essentially leads to someone getting paid for doing their job. However, that someone need not always be a citizen of that country. As a result we have to deduct that person's, say Ms. Omen income from GDP. Similarly, that country might have their own Mr. Nemo whose income, although not part of that country's GDP, needs to be added. 

All of the above finally boils down to-

1. **Gross national income = Gross domestic product (GDP) + Net primary income**
2. **Gross national income = Gross domestic product (GDP) + Mr. Nemo's income - Ms. Omen's income.**
