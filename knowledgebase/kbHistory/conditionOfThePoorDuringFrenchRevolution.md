Prior to the French Revolution it was people from the third estate who had to pay taxes (**Tithe-church, Taille- State**)and feudal dues- like serving the nobility or fighting for them . However, 90% of them were poor peasants. The condition of the poor remained unchanged even after the formation of the constitutional republic. Much of the power including the right to vote was in the hands of the wealthy and they did little to ameliorate the conditions of the poor. Because of this food prices continued to rise and there was no effective measures taken. Out of anger of the masses was then established the French Republic. To determine their own fate voting rights was extended to all men above the age of 21 irrespective of wealth. But after the fall of the republic the new constitution again took away the voting rights of the non-propertied section.

Irrespective of the rule the poor always suffered and the richer section traded power among themselved
