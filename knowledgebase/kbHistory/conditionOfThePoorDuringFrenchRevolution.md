# Condition of the poor during the French Revolution

Prior to the French Revolution it was only the people from the third estate who would pay taxes (**Tithe-paid to the church, Taille- paid to the State**) and feudal dues- like serving the nobility or fighting for them . However, 90% of them were poor peasants. Their condition remained unchanged even after the formation of the constitutional monarchy. Much of the power including the right to vote was in the hands of the wealthy and they did little to ameliorate the conditions of the poor. Indifference and inaction led to the rise of food prices. This was met with the anger of the masses which then established the French Republic. To determine their own fate voting rights was extended to all men above the age of 21 irrespective of wealth. But after the fall of the republic the new constitution again took away the voting rights of the non-propertied section.Irrespective of the rule the poor always suffered and the richer section traded power among themselves.
