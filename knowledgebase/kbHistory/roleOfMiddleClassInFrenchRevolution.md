But they were in a minority since around 90% of the people were poor peasant. But with increasing participation of the people of the third estate in overseas trade wealth began to find ways into in their households. These people were part of the emerging middle class. Not only could they now mobilize resources but they also actively took part in discussions regarding the novel ideas of social contract and division of power. With exposure to such ideas they began to refute the theory of divine right and believed in restructuring of social positions based on merit. As such played they played a pivotal role in convening of the National Assembly after the Tennis court oath which finally culminated with the establishment of constitutional monarchy in France.
