The poor before being poor are people. It might be difficult being poor but it would definitely be more difficult not being  people. When we question their decision to have kids on the basis of economics we also implicitly assume that they are completely rational beings. But in doing so we forget that they, you, and I are not Homo economicus but Homo sapiens. 

This emotion, however, need not always be guided by a desire for having a child for it can also be a manifestation of social expectations. Most, if not all, live in a family and this institution of family expects each individual to conform to their socially determined roles. In this case it expects a couple to have a child. This decision, therefore,  although seems voluntary but in practice it is the society acting through the individual.

On the other hand for someone to be rational it is necessary that they are well informed. It is only when people can make informed choices can they at least make an attempt to be rational. Being mired in poverty and still having access to information when making choices remains a far cry. It is difficult to imagine them making informed sexual, reproductive and economic choices unless the state ensures that everybody has access to it. The recent reports of vaccine hesitancy across the world however speaks otherwise.

Maybe the sciences are yet to comprehend as to why someone already living under tough situations would anyway bring a new being to live under the same horrid and nasty situations. Perhaps this 'why?' is best understood with the story of Morpheus, the king of dreams, in Neil Gaiman's Sandman. 

*Morpheus, the king of dreams, had his crown stolen by a demon who was hiding in hell. Upon reaching hell Morpheus demanded that the crown be returned to him. The demon did agree but on a condition that he would have to face him in a duel. This duel is much similar to today's rock paper scissors where one trumps the other. But in this case it was their imagination that had to trump the other. The demon went first and claimed that he was a dire wolf. Morpheus in order to trump him said that he was a hunter riding on a horse and thus killing the dire wolf. Then the demon became a fly stinging the horse and eventually overthrowing the hunter. To kill the fly came the spider, to kill the spider came the snake, to kill the snake came the bull, to kill the bull came the anthrax. Morpheus now becomes the world which nurtures the anthrax. The demon still on the aggressive side becomes a supernova destroying worlds.  Morpheus expands himself to become the universe in which everything finds its place, both life and death. With an intention of ending this duel the demon now comes with a final blow and proclaims to be the end of the universe, to be the darkness, to be nothingness!In this silence which follows the final blow the demon asks Morpheus what would he be now when there is nothing else left to be?* 

*Morpheus says, "I am hope."*

And it is here in Morpheus' answer that we shall find our own answer. Perhaps that is why they still choose to give birth. In each they see hope. A hope for a better world.
